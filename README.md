# Molokai Color Scheme for Vim 

Molokai is a Vim port of the monokai theme for TextMate originally created by Wimer Hazenberg.

This fork is a personal touch on the Molokai colorscheme. Notable differences
are:
- darker background to match the default xterm background
- light purple color for strings instead of the navajo white

Don't forget to add
